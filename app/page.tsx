                London, Buenos Aires, Hyderabad, Berlin, Seoul, and San Francisco
                exploring computer science and playing football.

                Past me was incubated by Softbank in Tokyo for a summer, interned as a
                software engineer at Solar BI and Phala Network, explored nature
                in the Pacific Northwest at Pearson College UWC, and cram-studied at
                St. Paul's Co-ed in Hong Kong.
